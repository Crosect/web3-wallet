# web3_wallet

Bundle of web3 libraries for mobile/desktop/web.

## Getting Started

The library uses a combination of two web3 libraries: [flutter_web3](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_web3) and [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart). Using this library is very useful when you develop apps on multiple platforms.

Here we use the proxy pattern to create it. Package will check the platform in use and go to the appropriate web3 package.
